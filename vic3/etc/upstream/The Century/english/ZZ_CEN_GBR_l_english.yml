The Empire enforced firm religious & cultural homogeneity with all non-Orthodox religions formally forbidden from proselytizing and a campaign of Russification implemented, being the policy of enforcing Russian culture on the vast numbers of ethnic minorities that lived in the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Empire does not grant autonomy to the core Imperial lands and doing so will greatly anger our [concept_interest_group] and reduce our [concept_authority].\nThe effects will scale proportional to the number of [GetCulture('russian').GetName], [GetCulture('byelorussian').GetName], [GetCulture('ukrainian').GetName] or [GetCulture('polish').GetName] [concept_homeland] under our subjects' control rather than our own."
