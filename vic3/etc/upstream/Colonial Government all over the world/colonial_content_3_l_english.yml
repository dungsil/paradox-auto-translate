je_colonial_administration_reason: "In order to best leverage our rule over our African holdings, a #bold Colonial Administration#! may be established over a given region of the continent. #bold Colonial Administrations#! will expand into neighboring [Concept('concept_decentralized_nation', '$concept_decentralized_nations$')] on their own, and may be given jurisdiction over our other regional holdings.\n\n#lore The Scramble for Africa, so it is called, is underway in earnest.

Rich in untapped resources and filled with people yet to be put to work, power and prestige are the prizes for the victors. Make no mistake: blood will be spilled long before the scramble ends. Africa awaits.#!"
