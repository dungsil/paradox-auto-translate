	YAKHCHAL_GLOSS: "#bold Yakhchals#!, meaning #italic ice pit#!, are buildings traditionally used to store ice and snow in [GetGeographicalRegion('world_middle_east_persia').GetName]. Though the simplest Yakhchals were storage pits dug into the ground, more complex variations were dome-shaped structures that were built above ground. They were engineered to utilize the physics of evaporative cooling and radiative cooling to maintain a low temperature. Yakhchals were used frequently by Iranians of all social classes, particularly in more arid climates, well into the 20th century to provide cooled food and drink, such as sorbets and chilled wine. For instance, a 19th century German traveler, Ernst Hoeltzer, mentioned how even the poor used Yakhchal to store water, and people could buy ice in the bazaar or straight from a Yakhchal." # null
